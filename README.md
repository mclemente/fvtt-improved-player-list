# Improved Player List

This module allows users to set the name that is shown between the square brackets to the side of their names.
Do you have player characters named "Sir Bearington" but their name in the list shows as "Sir"? You can fix it.
Do you want to be called a DM, Lorekeeper, Story Guide, Marshall, etc? You can do it.

## How to Use
Activate the module and go into the User Configuration menu, it will be showing a "Name" listed above Player Color.
Input anything in there and it will reflect in the Player List.
If you want to revert the changes, just erase it and save.
